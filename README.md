### Back Tapper Functionality
To ensure that back tapping works, the βTap Service application must be installed on the device. Simply install the application from Google Play - [Download βTap Service](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prhlt.aemus.BoDTapService). Then, the application that uses the cursor should be able to perform the clicking function via a back tap.
